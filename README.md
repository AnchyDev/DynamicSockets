# Dynamic Sockets
This module adds dynamic sockets to every item in the game. Allowing you to socket any item up to 3 times and add an additional enchant.

Note: This module is in active development and is not ready for use.

## ⚠️ Attention ⚠️
This module will **WIPE** the sockets from all armor and weapons. So make sure to backup your `item_template` if you want to revert this module in the future.
